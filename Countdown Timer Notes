//Description: this is a new brand of bedtime app that is different from all others apps out there. No apps on the app store can directly do this
//actively countdown and send notifications reminding you to go to bed at a specific time. The closest apps recommend bedtimes that correspond to waking time and only tell you how long you've slept
//this is an active push to fall asleep at a specific time

//Problem: convert the picker time into actual units i can use just like the currenttime format
//do the actual logic of the countdown now where given the two times, find the difference (absolute value) and live update the decreasing difference
//also, look at date format deprecation warning
//position everything comfortably and try to use the flex layouts so it looks good on every device
//SAVE the state of the picker after the app closes --> https://github.com/mCodex/react-native-sensitive-info, https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29988487/storing-userpreferences-with-a-react-native-app, https://github.com/kevinresol/react-native-default-preference, https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29284705/saving-data-upon-closing-app-and-retrieving-that-data
//SEND NOTIFICATIONS REMINDING WHEN TO GO TO SLEEP, HAVE NESTED NAVIGATION!
//make the picker a pop up menu instead of remaining on the screen


//My steps:
The first thing I did was research easy ways to display dates in the format I wanted in JS.
I tackled the problem one step at a time, and even if I didn't move in the direction of the end product,
I still created cool resources that I can use later. I wasn't overwhelmed or confused with a blank slate because
this was a slow work in progress that I would casually work on at night sometimes.
So, I found moment.js to format dates. Next, I identified problems I needed to solve.
First, I organized the screen layout a little bit to roughly proportion everything (using flexbox).
Next, I focused on finding a way to gauge user input and settled on a "picker" component.
This took forever to format correctly and to lay out on the screen (1 week of casual work on the side? 1 hr work total?).
Next, I tackled converting the input into a time that I could use to count down to. For instance, I didn't want to use a picker that displayed
military time (i wanted AM and PM), and my countdown logic uses hours converted to seconds
