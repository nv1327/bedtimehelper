# bedtimehelper

This React Native app is an app that takes the current time off of the user's phone
using local data and taking user input through the form of a table picker (the desired time to sleep)
and tells the user second by second how much time they have until they need to go
to bed at their designated time.

Check the other readme for setup, and check out the code to learn some of the logic!
